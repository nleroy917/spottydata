    artistNetwork: "Your artist network is a visual map of how your artists are collaborating with each other across all of your playlists. Each band represents two artists who have collaborated on the same track. The thickness of the band represents how many unique collaborations they've done. Tap the chart to explore the data!",
    songCalendar: "The song calendar shows you how many songs you've added over the last year and when you added them. This map represents only playlists you author and songs thay you've added to them. Also, for brevity, it only includes songs in the last year -- the data is much more digestible this way."
