  artistNetwork:
    "Your artist network is a visual map of how your artists are collaborating with each other across all of your playlists. Each band represents two artists who have collaborated on the same track. The thickness of the band represents how many unique collaborations they've done. Tap the chart to explore the data!",
  songCalendar:
    "The song calendar shows you how many songs you've added over the last year and when you added them. This map represents only playlists you author and songs thay you've added to them. Also, for brevity, it only includes songs in the last year -- the data is much more digestible this way.",
  keyChart:
    'The key chart shows the disribution of your music that belongs to certain musical keys. Music is split up by keys and the modality of the song (i.e. Major or Minor).',
  genreChart:
    "Your profile analysis includes all the genres that you listen to the most. Below are your top 5 genres that you listen to across all your music. In Spotify, genres arn't tied to songs, rather they are tied to Artists. Thus, these are the top 5 genres that are associated with the artists you listen to.",
  featureChart:
    'Spotify gives us feature data for each song in their database. Things like Acousticness, Loudness, Valence, Danceability, etc. We can compare our playlists across all of these metrics to see how they stack up next to each other when it comes to these data. Note that performance on mobile will be quite poor due to the intensive data requirements.',
